Description: Creates BioXSD compliant XML out of norsnet output
 The package contains a Python script that allows the creation of BioXSD 
 compliant XML from norsnet output. The code is based on the lxml library
 and wraps the information from the norsnet columns in valid BioXSD XML tags.
 This code was produced for a university practical exercise. The developers 
 hope to aid the unification of bioinformatics data formats and save  
 the coming generations of bioinformaticians the task of writing parsers.
