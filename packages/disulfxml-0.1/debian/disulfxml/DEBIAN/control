Description: Creates BioXSD compliant XML from disulfinder
 This package contains a Python script that will wrap disulfinder output
 with BioXSD XML tags. It is thus the hope of the authors to contribute towards
 the unification of all formats in Bioinformatics, thus sparing the coming
 generations of having to write parsers for everything.
