This directory contains the source needed for the creation of the 
disulfxml package. The file that is actually used is of course 
disulfxml. The file dsToXML.py is kept for historical reasons, and
as a kind of fallback because redundancy is cool.

Also, because it is not so self-evident, the file "test.xml" has 
been renamed to Q30201.out. This is the test case used for the 
developement of the package.
